# üè• Hospital Provider Cost Report Data Analysis

This project analyzes **Medicare Hospital Provider Cost Report** data to uncover insights into healthcare provider expenses, utilization patterns, and geographic disparities. The goal is to clean, validate, and visualize hospital cost data for meaningful healthcare analytics.

## Objectives
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues to ensure reliable analysis.
- Data Quality Checks: Identify outliers, validate data types, and confirm consistency across reporting periods.
- Cost Trend Analysis: Explore hospital cost patterns across years, states, and provider types.
- Ownership Comparisons: Compare expenses and performance between nonprofit, government, and proprietary hospitals.
- Geographic Insights: Highlight state and regional differences in provider costs and utilization.
- Visualization & Reporting: Create charts, dashboards, and summaries to communicate key findings effectively.
- Portfolio Demonstration: Showcase practical skills in Python, SQL, and visualization tools for healthcare analytics.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python: Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn for charts and trend analysis
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis and documentation
- Microsoft Excel: Data exploration, validation, and quick summaries
- Power BI / Tableau (optional): Interactive dashboards for stakeholders
- Git & GitHub: Version control and project collaboration
- CMS Medicare Cost Report Data: Public dataset used for analysis

## Key Insights
- State-Level Trends: Certain states consistently report higher hospital costs, highlighting regional disparities in healthcare expenses.
- Ownership Differences: Nonprofit hospitals generally report different cost structures compared to proprietary and government-owned facilities.
- Service Utilization: Inpatient vs. outpatient service costs reveal variations in how hospitals allocate resources.
- Time-Based Patterns: Year-over-year analysis shows shifts in hospital expenditures, potentially linked to policy changes or economic factors.
- Data Quality Observations: Missing values and outliers are common in self-reported data, requiring robust cleaning and validation for accurate insights.
