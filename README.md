# üè• Hospital Provider Cost Report Data Analysis
## Exploratory Data Analysis on Hospital Provider Cost Reports

## General Overview
This project analyzes **Medicare Hospital Provider Cost Report** data to uncover insights into healthcare provider expenses, utilization patterns, and geographic disparities. The goal is to clean, validate, and visualize hospital cost data for meaningful healthcare analytics.

## Background
The Hospital Provider Cost Report dataset, published by CMS, contains annual self-reported financial and utilization data from U.S. hospitals participating in Medicare. It includes information on hospital costs, revenues, ownership types, and patient statistics, making it a key resource for analyzing healthcare expenses, efficiency, and regional disparities.

## Key Insights
- State-Level Trends: Certain states consistently report higher hospital costs, highlighting regional disparities in healthcare expenses.
- Ownership Differences: Nonprofit hospitals generally report different cost structures compared to proprietary and government-owned facilities.
- Service Utilization: Inpatient vs. outpatient service costs reveal variations in how hospitals allocate resources.
- Time-Based Patterns: Year-over-year analysis shows shifts in hospital expenditures, potentially linked to policy changes or economic factors.
- Data Quality Observations: Missing values and outliers are common in self-reported data, requiring robust cleaning and validation for accurate insights.

### Research Questions
Financial Performance
- How has hospital net income changed over time, both nationally and by state?
- What is the average cost-to-charge ratio across hospitals, and which hospitals are outliers?
- How has the cost-to-charge ratio evolved over the years?
- How do urban vs. rural hospitals differ in financial performance trends?
- What are the long-term trends in assets, liabilities, and fund balances?

Capacity & Operations
- Which states or counties have the highest hospital capacity in terms of beds and patient days?
- How has staffing (FTE employees) changed relative to patient volume?

Care Delivery & Equity
- What are the trends in charity care and uncompensated care over time?
- How much uncompensated care is provided by region or hospital type?
- How do inpatient vs. outpatient revenues vary by hospital size and type?

## Objectives
The objective of this study is to develop and showcase strong data analysis skills through a meaningful project addressing real-world healthcare data challenges. The insights derived from the analysis are intended to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding hospital resource allocation, cost management, and regulatory oversight.

- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handle missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues to ensure reliable analysis.
- Data Quality Checks: Identify outliers, validate data types, and confirm consistency across reporting periods.
- Cost Trend Analysis: Explore hospital cost patterns across years, states, and provider types.
- Ownership Comparisons: Compare expenses and performance between nonprofit, government, and proprietary hospitals.
- Geographic Insights: Highlight state and regional differences in provider costs and utilization.
- Visualization & Reporting: Create charts, dashboards, and summaries to communicate key findings effectively.
- Portfolio Demonstration: Showcase practical skills in Python, SQL, and visualization tools for healthcare analytics.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python: Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn for charts and trend analysis
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis and documentation
- Microsoft Excel: Data exploration, validation, and quick summaries
- Power BI / Tableau (optional): Interactive dashboards for stakeholders
- Git & GitHub: Version control and project collaboration
- CMS Medicare Cost Report Data: Public dataset used for analysis

## Data Source
This report provides an in-depth analysis of hospital provider enrollment and cost data obtained from the Provider Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS). Following the July 17, 2023 data refresh, the dataset was expanded to include additional provider types such as Critical Access Hospitals (CAH) and Rural Emergency Hospitals (REH), broadening the scope of the analysis.

The Hospital Provider Cost Report dataset provides select measures from the hospital annual cost report. This data includes provider information such as facility characteristics, utilization data, cost and charges by cost center (in total and for Medicare), Medicare settlement data, and financial statement data organized by CMS Certification Number.

The data is publicly available from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS](https://data.cms.gov/provider-compliance/cost-report/hospital-provider-cost-report).
